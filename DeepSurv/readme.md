GitHub renders Python notebooks as static html files. Therefore, the markdown text does not visualize correctly when viewing .ipynb notebooks on GitHub. You can either 
1. open a local copy in Jupyter Notebook or 
2. enter the link in parentheses (https://github.com/timfingerhut/migration/blob/master/DeepSurv/DeepSurv_FINAL.ipynb) in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).
