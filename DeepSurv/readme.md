GitHub renders Python notebooks as static html files. Therefore, the markdown text does not visualize correctly when viewing .ipynb notebooks on GitHub. You can either open a local copy in Jupyter Notebook or have look at the notebook online on [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://github.com/timfingerhut/migration/blob/master/DeepSurv/DeepSurv_FINAL.ipynb).
