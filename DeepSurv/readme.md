GitHub renders Python notebooks as static html files. Therefore, the notebook does not visualize correctly on GitHub. You can either:
1. open a local copy in Jupyter Notebook or 
2. enter the link in parentheses (https://github.com/timfingerhut/migration/blob/master/DeepSurv/DeepSurv-FINAL.ipynb) in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) or
3. have a look at the attached pdf file if you do not plan to apply DeepSurv yourself.
