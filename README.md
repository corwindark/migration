Welcome! This repository contains documents related to my Master Thesis with the title: 

*"Models of Migration Time and Refugee Well-being - Applying Causal Inference, Event History Analysis and Deep Learning to the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees in Germany"*. 

If you have any questions or would like to read my thesis, please send me an email: timfingerhut@gmail.com. 

Let me summarize what you can and cannot find here: 

1) **Data**: Contractual obligations with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) stipulate that it is not allowed to share the data from the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees in Germany. If you want to work with the same dataset, you can apply for access through the [DIW/SOEP website](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.357906.en/soep_order_form_mod.html). 

2) **Figures**: This path contains all figures that are part of the thesis in high resolution.

3) **DeepSurv**: You can find the Python notebook used for the DeepSurv application on this path. I also uploaded the PDF output for convenience. 

4) **Hyperparameter Tuning**: As described in the thesis, I followed a four-step manual hyperparameter tuning procedure. Files on this path document the hyperparameter tuning. For an example of an implemented random hyperparameter search for DeepSurv, please have a look at [Jared Lee Katzman's DeepSurv repository](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv/tree/master/hyperparam_search). 

5) **Map Data**: I created Map 1 using [Heatmapper](http://www2.heatmapper.ca). I uploaded the raw data of the number of Syrian respondents by region to the Map Data folder. 

6) **STATA Code**: This path contains the STATA Do-File. It contains all the relevant code for Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox regressions, data preprocessing and normalization as well as the various statistical tests implemented in the thesis.
